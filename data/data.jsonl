Systems: Includes a skill panel and a “master everything” achievement; also features two tiers of financial goals. Cooking prerequisite: Some early recipes require growing the ingredients yourself, as they cannot be bought in shops.

Map scale: A small set of explorable hubs; beyond the town area, locations expand to a lighthouse, a shrine, and an offshore island.
